Symfony Reference Examples
==========================

A symfony2 example project useful as a quick reference guide to get common tasks
done quickly. 

The project includes Doctrine Entities annotated to allow database generation and validation constraints meaning that the entities can also be validated.

The Doctrine Entities also include some basic assocations which function correctly when the form is correctly filled in and persisted to the database.

The form itself is a collection of three smaller forms generated by Symfony from the Doctrine Entities.  These forms are pooled together into one single form which then sets the accepted data into the individual entities and validates them prior to persisting.


All of this code is then put through some basic tests (a test database is required).  These include a functional test of the whole process, simple tests of individual forms that persist to corresponding tables and validation tests to check constraints function correctly.  The testing process is not exhaustive but provides sufficient examples to apply to larger projects quickly.
